    <h2 style="margin-top:0px;">ENDODONTIC THERAPY </h2>

        <p>Endodontic therapy, better known as a 'root canal,' has received a bad reputation over the years, partially due to misleading information. The therapy is actually less painful than some other commonly performed procedures.</p>

<p>Using a local anesthetic, the procedure begins with the isolation of the infected tooth. The crown of the tooth is then opened to allow access to the root canal. The infected pulp that is responsible for tooth pain is removed from the canal and replaced with a special compound. The canal is then permanently sealed to prevent bacteria from reentering. A filling is placed in the opening of the crown and a final restoration is fitted. The complexity of the restoration is heavily dependent upon the extent of the damage to the original tooth. </p>

<p>The pulp tissue of a tooth can be severely damaged from advanced tooth decay. Endodontic therapy is an excellent way of avoiding extraction and restoring damaged teeth. This procedure no longer has to be associated with anxiety or fear. </p>

<h2>DENTURES/PARTIALS</h2>
<p>For hundreds of years, dentures have provided numerous benefits for those who have lost their teeth. It is believed that the earliest dentures may date as far back as 700 B.C.! Unlike the ivory and bone dentures of ancient times, modern-day dentures are made of a durable acrylic resin or a combination of acrylic resin and metal. The type of denture chosen will depend on your individual case.</p>

<strong>Types of Dentures:</strong> <br /><br />

<p><b>Complete Dentures</b> - Used for individuals who have lost all of their teeth, these dentures, comprised of artificial teeth and gums, fit directly over the upper and lower gums.</p>

<p><b>Partial Dentures</b> - These artificial teeth and gums are held in place by clasps for those who have lost only a few teeth. </p>

<p><b>Overdentures</b> - Used when a few healthy teeth remain, these dentures fit over the remaining healthy teeth or over dental implants. The natural teeth and/or dental implants provide added stability and also help to retain bone integrity.</p>

<p>Dentures can be placed either immediately following tooth removal or after the bone and tissue have had time to heal. Although not the most aesthetically appealing choice, the latter technique is often more effective as dentures fitted before the mouth has healed tend to require additional follow-up adjustments. </p>

<p>Adjusting to your new dentures will take time. The doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for your dentures and tips on making your adjustment period as smooth as possible. </p>

<p><b>The Procedure:</b><br />
The doctor will first conduct a thorough examination of your mouth, including soft tissue and bone structure; if appropriate, he will also assess the condition of remaining teeth and customize your treatment accordingly. Immediate dentures are placed directly after the teeth are extracted. Traditional dentures are developed from an impression in a laboratory; any areas where teeth have been extracted are first allowed to heal, and the dentures are then placed. Immediate dentures often require more follow-up adjustments since the dentures may shift as the mouth heals. Partials involve a less labor-intensive procedure, as they are simply connected with a metal clasp.</p>

<p>Please <a href="contact.html">contact our office</a> if you think dentures might be a viable option for you.</p>
 

<h2>CROWNS</h2>
<p>Crowns are dental restorations that encase the entire surface area of a tooth that has been severely damaged due to decay or trauma. Crowns are usually used to reinforce teeth that have been broken or at risk of cracking. They are generally made from porcelain, metal or a combination of the two. </p>

<p>During the first of two visits, the dentist will reduce some of the natural tooth's structure to prepare for the crown. An impression is then taken and sent to a lab, where the permanent crown is carefully constructed. A temporary crown is usually placed at this time. During the second and final visit, the temporary crown is removed and the permanent is cemented into place. </p>

<p>Crowns can dramatically improve the appearance of teeth and have been known to last up to fifteen years. Contact us if you feel this treatment might benefit you. </p>

<h2>BRIDGES</h2>
<p>Bridges are used to literally bridge a gap in the mouth where one or more natural teeth are missing. <b>Traditional bridges</b> consist of an artificial tooth or teeth supported by a crown on either side. <b>Resin bonded bridges</b> (known as Maryland bridges) are artificial teeth connected to metal bands which are bonded to the teeth with a resin cement. Maryland bridges are typically used to replace missing front teeth. Cantilever bridges are used when there is only one tooth next to the space being filled. <b>Cantilever bridges</b> consist of an artificial tooth supported by two crowns attached on one side. </p>

<p><b>The Procedure:</b><br />
Using a local anesthetic, the doctor will first remove some material from the natural teeth surrounding the gap. An impression is taken and sent to a laboratory, where the bridge will be created. At this time, the doctor will insert a temporary bridge. The permanent bridge usually returns from the laboratory within one to two weeks. Finally, the bridge is cemented into place. </p>

<p>The benefits of dental bridges are clear. It is virtually impossible to distinguish between dental bridges and natural teeth. Also, a gap left too long in the mouth can have a negative impact on bone structure and the health of neighboring teeth. Fixed bridges can last anywhere from seven to fifteen years. </p>

<p>If you would like to join the many satisfied customers who have improved their smiles with dental bridges, please contact us to schedule an appointment.</p>

<h2>TMJ TREATMENTS </h2>
<p>Imagine feeling pain each time you chew, yawn or talk. Imagine a constant ringing sound in your ears and chronic neck and back pain. This is what it can feel like to suffer from TMJ disorder, also known as temporomandibular joint disorder. </p>

<p>The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) connects the lower jaw to the temporal bone of the skull. TMJ disorder is characterized by pain in the jaw area. The most common symptom of TMJ disorder is clicking of the jaw. Other symptoms can include neck and back pain, locked jaw and headaches. The usual cause of TMJ disorder is trauma resulting from a variety of factors, including car accidents, tooth grinding, a bad bite (malocclusion) or a blow to the head. </p>
